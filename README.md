# ReduceNative
A native (well, not quite) code based REDUCE CAS port to Android

## Implementation details
This project uses Katex to render REDUCE output, so it can be quite slow.  
REDUCE binary itself is built with a proprietary toolchain. It is static, so it may cause problems with future Android versions, if you want to continue this project, you'd better go with NDK.

## Further development
I will be happy if you fork this project so our work will not get lost, but we will not provide any support for this project.  
The reason is the ongoing hostility of Android [towards native applications](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/1072) and [their access to files](https://www.xda-developers.com/android-q-storage-access-framework-scoped-storage/), so I found this platform not worthwile anymore.
